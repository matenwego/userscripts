Jira User Scripts
=================

These are scripts I've written to make my life a little easier when using [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).


Auto Update Date Started
------------------------

When logging work on an issue, updating the Time Spent field will automatically set the Date Started based on the user's current time.

Install `Auto_update_date_started.user.js`.
