thzinc's User Scripts
=====================

These are a collection of my own public user scripts (Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, *monkey, etc.) that I've found useful.

MediaWiki single-column PrefixIndex maker
-----------------------------------------

Does the forced three-column layout of the MediaWiki PrefixIndex annoy you, or worse, prevent you from finding the information you need? Eschew the three-column layout and make it one with this script!

It works on any standard MediaWiki, including Wikipedia.

Live better! Install [`MediaWiki single-column PrefixIndex maker`](MediaWiki single-column PrefixIndex maker.js)


No HTTPS for SuperBetter Forums
-------------------------------

A not-great workaround for the SuperBetter Forums that currently have a revoked SSL certificate. 

Install [`No HTTPS for SuperBetter Forums`](No HTTPS for SuperBetter Forums.js)
